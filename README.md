## Developed this app to learn webpack configuration from scratch
- **Developed a small app by using webpack for bundling**
- **Used all minifying and optimization plugins to improve performance.**
- **Configured different plugins for Dev and Prod builds.**
- **Used loaders to convert Saas & TS files**
- **Extracted CSS into separate files for Prod, instead of injecting it in HTML**
- **For Prod - Optimized all HTML,CSS, JS files by minifying, removing all comments & console.logs using Terser Plugin**
- **Used babel loader to support old browsers.**
- **Added hash content code tn final bundle files, to improve browser caching.**
- **Splitted final bundle into multiple files to separate my own code and third-party(vendor) code.**
- **Used webpack-dev-server for serving the app in dev**
